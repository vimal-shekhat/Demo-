# CakePHP Application Skeleton

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cakephp/app.png)](https://travis-ci.org/cakephp/app)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/cakephp/app/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cakephp/app)

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.0.

This is an unstable repository and should be treated as an alpha.

## Installation

=======
This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Git Internals for more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.)

If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git 

$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'initial project version'
